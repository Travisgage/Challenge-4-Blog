# Best-Blog-Ever

## Description
The following is a simple application for posting to a personal blog, with the creation of individual posts being streamlined for ease of use. Posts can be created using the blog form to enter a username, title, and then the content of the post. Local storage is used to allow for past posts to be viewed.

## Installation

## Usage
To use the application, navigate to the URL for the landing page. The user is then presented with a form to enter thir username, a title for their choice, and the written content of the blog post. When finished, the post will be created by pressing the 'submit' button. This will also redirect the user to the posts page, where the new post can be viewed along with all previous posts. The user can also toggle between a light or dark mode with the small icon left-hand corner. Finally, clicking 'go back' will take the user back to the landing page where a new post can be created.
